# Face Detection

![Face Detection Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Face Detection is a web-based application that uses OpenCV and Flask to detect faces in images. This repository demonstrates how to integrate computer vision with a simple web interface.

## Overview

This project leverages Python, OpenCV, and Flask to perform face detection on images uploaded via a web interface. Whether you want to process static images or integrate the functionality into larger systems, this project provides a simple and effective starting point.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Automatically detects faces in uploaded images.
- **Web Interface:** A clean and simple web interface built using Flask.
- **Real-time Processing:** Quickly processes images to identify faces.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed to be integrated into other projects or extended further.

## Requirements

The application depends on the following Python packages:

```
blinker==1.9.0
click==8.1.8
colorama==0.4.6
Flask==3.1.0
Flask-Cors==5.0.0
itsdangerous==2.2.0
Jinja2==3.1.5
MarkupSafe==3.0.2
numpy==2.2.3
opencv-python==4.11.0.86
pillow==11.1.0
Werkzeug==3.1.3
```

You can install these dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AmalRaghk/Face_Detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```
   cd Face_Detection
   ```

3. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   For Unix/macOS:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   For Windows:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Flask Server**

   Launch the application by running:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface**

   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
   
3. **Upload an Image**

   Use the web interface to upload an image and see face detection in action!

## Configuration

- **Face Detection Parameters:** Modify detection parameters directly in the source code if needed.
- **Flask Settings:** Adjust Flask settings (e.g., port number, debug mode) within `app.py` or a separate configuration file if provided.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Verify your Python environment and package versions.
- Check for error messages in the terminal if the application does not start as expected.
