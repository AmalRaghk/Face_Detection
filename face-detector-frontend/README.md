# Face Detection Application 👤✨

A web application built to detect faces in images using computer vision! With a simple and interactive interface, users can upload images, and the app will highlight and identify faces using advanced computer vision techniques. 🔍🤖

## 📜 Project Overview

**Title:** Face Detection Application

**Description:**  
This web application allows users to upload images and detect faces present in them. Built with a React frontend (powered by Vite) and a Flask backend using OpenCV for face detection. The app provides an intuitive user experience with real-time face visualization.

**Features:**
- **Image Upload** 📸: Upload images from your local storage.
- **Face Detection** 👀: Detects and highlights faces in the uploaded image.
- **Visualization** 🌟: Displays the result with bounding boxes around detected faces.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Frontend Setup (React + Vite)
To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-app.git
   cd face-detection-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the frontend:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 2. Backend Setup (Flask + OpenCV)
To set up the backend, you'll need Python and virtual environments.

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd face-detection-app/backend
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**

   - If you don't have `venv` set up, you can create a virtual environment like this:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the backend server:**

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   The backend will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## ⚙️ Usage

### Running Both Frontend and Backend
- Ensure both the **frontend** and **backend** are running on different ports (default: `3000` for frontend, `5000` for backend).
- When the frontend is loaded, you can upload an image, and the application will send the image to the backend for face detection.

### API Endpoints

#### `POST /api/detect_faces`

- **Description:** Accepts an image and detects faces within it.
- **Request:**
  
  - **Body (Form Data):**  
    - `image`: The image file to process (jpg, png, etc.).
  
  - **Example Request (using cURL):**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -F "image=@path_to_your_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/api/detect_faces
    ```

- **Response:**
  
  - **Body (JSON):**  
    ```json
    {
      "faces": [
        {
          "x": 120,
          "y": 80,
          "width": 200,
          "height": 200
        },
        {
          "x": 300,
          "y": 150,
          "width": 180,
          "height": 180
        }
      ],
      "message": "Faces detected successfully"
    }
    ```
